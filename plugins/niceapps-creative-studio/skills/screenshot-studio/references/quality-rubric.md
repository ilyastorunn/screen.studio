# Screenshot quality rubric

Score each dimension from 0 to 5 and explain any score below 4.

| Dimension | Evaluation question |
| --- | --- |
| Product understanding | Does the set represent the app's actual audience, problem, and outcome? |
| Reference relevance | Is every reference selected for a clear, defensible reason? |
| Narrative | Does the sequence progress without repeating the same message? |
| Copy | Is the copy specific, readable, concise, and supported by evidence? |
| UI selection | Does each chosen product screen prove the accompanying claim? |
| Visual system | Is the set coherent without becoming compositionally monotonous? |
| Readiness | Is every frame already a separately exported, opaque, correctly sized ASC upload rather than merely ready to proceed to export? |

Use these failure tags when relevant:

- `insufficient-app-context`
- `wrong-reference-selection`
- `generic-copy`
- `unsupported-claim`
- `weak-narrative`
- `poor-ui-selection`
- `visual-inconsistency`
- `unreadable-text`
- `over-derived-from-reference`
- `missing-raw-screens`
- `wrong-asc-dimensions`
- `non-uploadable-artifact`
- `mutated-source-ui`

## Final-output gate

A set cannot score above 2 for readiness or be called final unless all of the following are verified:

- a current Apple-supported screenshot slot and device family are named;
- every ordered frame exists as its own PNG or JPEG at the slot's exact dimensions;
- files are opaque RGB, open successfully, and have deterministic sequence names;
- source UI remains faithful to the supplied capture rather than generatively reconstructed;
- headlines and supporting copy were checked in the rendered files;
- the set was inspected both at full resolution and at reduced storefront-like size.

The score is diagnostic, not proof of conversion performance. Never describe reference popularity, visual polish, or this rubric as an A/B test result.
